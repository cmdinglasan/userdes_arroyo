				<p>Hi! I'm Christian Dinglasan. I'm 19 years old and was born and grew up at Taguig City. I went to Taguig Science High School to study for both my junior and senior years. </p>

				<p>When I studied for my senior years, the K-12 curriculum was newly implemented. It was hard for me to adapt to the new subjects taught because our teachers were new to the curriculum.  </p>

				<p>I enjoy doing papercrafts and fixing electronics. When fixing electronics, I try to minimize my errors since electronics are sensitive and could cause harm and damage when wrongly fixed. I watch YouTube videos and make them as my guide on how to fix items. </p>

				<p>Based on the course's name, I expect that we will learn about designing graphical user interfaces for mobile applications and websites. </p>

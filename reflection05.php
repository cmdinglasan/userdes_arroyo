				<p>As an organizer for the School of Computing and Information Technology (SoCIT) Fest 2019, I was excited for the event to push through without a hitch. It was fun and exciting to become an organizer because you do not know what would happen through out the whole event. Even if you plan properly, there will come a time that what you realized would happen is not the same on what would happen.</p>
				<p>As an officer of Junior Philippine Computer Society – Asia Pacific College (JPCS-APC), it was very challenging, and this experience would be an addition to the memories and experiences I would not forget. It was both slightly frustrating but fun experience to remember. We JPCS-APC handled the events Agile Seminar, Fame or Shame, and UI Design. As a student, the Agile seminar taught us that there is an effective way of collaborating with less hassle and more advantages. Fame or Shame made me realize that with a small crowd, you can do more if you think of what the audience would be happy about. It’s all about fun – fun to learn, fun to entertain, and fun to collaborate. Even though it was frustrating at first, since we did have few audiences, we taught of a way that everyone would participate in the event. I always keep on reminding myself that there should be more positive outcomes that negative ones. The UI Design contest allowed us to view the students’ skills in recreating the APC portal (apc.edu.ph). Even though we only had four pairs of contestants, it was surely fun.</p>
				<p>I expect more things would come in the future especially with us collaborating with other SoCIT Organizations such as APC Microsoft Community, Junior Information Systems Security Association (JISSA-APC), and Gaming Genesis.</p>

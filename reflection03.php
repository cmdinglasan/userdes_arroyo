				<p>Since I’ve been designing typical static webpages using HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript for a couple of years, I found the activity to be easy and I am proud of what I accomplished. It still needs a little furnishing to be an interactive one even if it is just a basic webpage.</p>

				<p>However, I found some of my classmates do not know how to create a basic static HTML webpage and to connect from Github to Heroku. Since this is somehow their first time creating a web application, I helped some of them in creating one and connecting it with the hosting service provider. It was one way for me to teach them of what I know and what I experienced throughout the activity. It was difficult at first since I, too, was experiencing some problems regarding how we should connect our HTML-based website to Heroku since Heroku doesn’t merely support just HTML-based website.</p>

				<p>Still, it was a fun activity to see how others designed their personal webpages and it’s a good start in being a web designer.</p>

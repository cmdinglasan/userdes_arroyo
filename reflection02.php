				<p>This week was both entertaining and difficult at the same time. We had a discussion which is very interesting since design is not just the visual element of an app but rather all elements are important. It is not just what we want our app to look like but also it should help solve problems.</p>

				<p>Proper planning is essential in creating an application. We need to find solutions for different problems since technology now is in the palm of our hands. This was the problem our group experienced. We thought that there are too many apps created nowadays that we could only improve them or combine their features into another application.</p>

				<p>We thought of creating an application that could cater the following problems:</p>
				
				<ol>
					<li>Full or mostly occupied rooms</li>
					<li>Familiarity to places of nearby areas</li>
					<li>Traffic in the Metro and/or provinces</li>
					<li>Lack of information</li>
					<li>Familiarity to services offered by an institution</li>
				</ol>

				<p>We wanted to create an application for people to find near hospitals since we know that hospitalization in the Philippines is hard and most public hospitals could not cater large amounts of patients.</p>
